P51 Azure Infrastructure

Create an MS Azure Account. Unfortunately an educational free account will not allow us to create a new AD/SQL Server and WebApp. I had to create a new account, with $200 credit and pay as you go features (after the credit).

Log into Azure portal (portal.azure.com) to verify that account exists and can create all objects needed for Progetto Cinquantuno. We need:
	AD to manage servers/apps and to create SQL Server and Webapp

Active Directory
Create and Deploy Active Directory within Azure. 
	Create new resource group: Project51
	Primary Domain: NETORGFT8245949.onmicrosoft.com THIS IS ONLY FOR LOGGING IN
	Region: East US
	Domain Admin Name: Projectadmin
	Domain Admin Password: Progettoadmin!!
	Choose AD Version: Server 2019
	Domain/Forest Name: NETORGFT8245949.onmicrosoft.com
	Using two DC Vm's
	Create new AD-vnet as virtual network
	Create new DC Subnet 

	Ian Brown's Password:  Progetto51!! Made you a member of DCAdmin group
	Ibrown@NETORGFT8245949.onmicrosoft.com
	Cjunior@NETORGFT8245949.onmicrosoft.com
	dtepper@NETORGFT8245949.onmicrosoft.com
	Progetto51!!

Add public IP Address to AD infrastructure


Create SQL Server
	sql admin = p51admin 	pword = Progetto51!!

	To connect to the SQL Server we are using proxy to
	East US	40.121.158.30, 40.79.153.12, 40.78.225.32	20.42.65.64/29, 20.42.73.0/29, 52.168.116.64/29

I added all of our client IP Addresses in order to connect to the SQL Server and database within the firewall rules.

The server name to connect to is: project51.database.windows.net via sql server management studio

Create Webapp + Database (New experience) within Azure portal

Webapp details: 
	Name: project51.azurewebsites.net
	runtime stack: Java 11
	Java web server stack: Java SE (Embedded Web Server)

	Dabase Engine: SQLAzure
	Server Name: project51-server
	database name: p51

For the database: 
	username: project51-server-admin
	password: T2Y3Q327KP05W34D$

	connection to the web app database:
	Data Source=tcp:project51-server.database.windows.net,1433;Initial Catalog=p51;User Id=project51-server-admin@project51-server.database.windows.net;Password=T2Y3Q327KP05W34D$
